# x11docker-apps

These are GUI apps intended to be built with Docker, and run with [x11docker](https://github.com/mviereck/x11docker).

However, other than x11docker itself, there are [distro-specific dependencies](https://github.com/mviereck/x11docker/wiki/Dependencies#dependencies-of-feature-options), most notably, nxagent and xpra. Otherwise, you can try simply `--hostdisplay`.
